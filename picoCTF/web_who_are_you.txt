## writeup for web_Who_are_you?

# first it wanted to change the browser, so we went to burpsuite and we change
  the User-Agent to: "User-Agent: PicoBrowser"

# then it wanted from another site, so we add the Referer to: "Referer: mercury.picoctf.net:1270"

# then it said that the site only was working from back to 2018 so we add the Date to:
  "Date: Mon, 21 Feb 2018 12:34:56 GMT"

# Then it said that they cant trust us so we add DNT (Do Not Track header) to: "DNT: 1"

# then it said tit only accepts from sweden, so we search to goofle to find some public sweden Ip's
  and the add the X-Forwarded-For to: "X-Forwarded-For: 102.177.146.0"

# And for the last it says we are in Sweden but we dont speak Swedish, so we change the
  Accept-Language to: "Accept-Language: sv-sv,en;q=0.5" and finally we get the flag :)
